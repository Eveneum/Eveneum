	And an existing snapshot for version 200
	And an existing stream D with 50 events
	And an existing stream I with 0 events
	And an existing stream J with 10 events
	When I load stream headers using query text SELECT * from c WHERE c.DocumentType = 'Header' and c.Version > 75
	Then the stream header for stream B in version 100 is returned
	And the stream header for stream C in version 200 is returned
	And request charge is reported
